======= DevEnvNotes ==============
A) Enable python env
source activate RoboND #Linux

B) Run Rover program
python RoverMain.py # from shell
exec(open("RoverMain.py").read()) # from interpreter
exec(open("./RoverMain.py").read(), globals())

---Rover Behaviour:
V max ~=5m/s
A = 1m/s/s (only throttle position)
Brake power is much stronger than throttle
-A ~=2.5m/s
Slope affects speed
Drag appears to be proportional to V**2
Turning increases drag alot
Steering is active at 0V

Environment:
Tracks disappear after a minute or so
Some bajadas are very sand colored
IsNear is a basketball foul box shape about 1m long and outer wheel edge wide
