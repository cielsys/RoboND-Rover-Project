## Important Notes for review:
  My files are named differently and in a different location than the original project.

* My testing notebook and python files and  are located in $REPO/cl_code/
* Main file is rovermain.py in that directory
* The original code has not been modified

  This is a fun project! The Jupyter notebook exercises were manageable but required thought and understanding.
The actual simulator control was somewhat involved. And trying to graft things back and forth between the notebook, which is good for debugging,
and the actual sim control application was tricky. I found that I wanted to refactor things so that they would be using almost entirely the same code and in retrospect I should have just worked to get the assingment done on time.

I will submit this writeup in this state, as it is deadline time. 
The Sim controller actually does usually map more than 50% of the terrain with 70% fidelity.
